Project Retouch Update
•	I retouched the project by focusing on the HTML structure and rearranging the files.
•	I also simplified the CSS code to make it cleaner and easier to manage.
•	If I were to start over, I would aim for an even simpler and cleaner design, and I would change the overall design as well.
•	However, for this project, I chose to challenge myself by improving what I already had rather than starting from nothing.
